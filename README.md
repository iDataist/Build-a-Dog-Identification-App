#  Build a Dog Identification App

I developed an algorithm that could be used as part of a mobile or web app, which accepts any user-supplied image as input.  If a dog is detected in the image, it will provide an estimate of the dog's breed.  If a human is detected, it will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Process the image data
- Build and train a convolutional neural network
- Use Transfer Learning
